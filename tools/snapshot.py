"""Copy a file to a snapshot path, byte for byte.

Why a tool and not `cp`: the agent that runs this chooses its own shell, and the three shells
available on this machine spell a copy three different ways — `cp` in Git Bash, `Copy-Item` in
PowerShell, `copy` in cmd. A python call reads the same in all three and cannot be talked into
globbing something it was not asked to touch.

Why snapshots at all: the revision loop overwrites `article.md` every round. The round records
keep the verdicts and the remarks, so what a critic said in round 8 survives — but the draft it
said it about does not. Comparing what actually changed between two rounds was impossible, which
is exactly the question worth asking when a loop stops converging.

The copy is verbatim and the destination is refused if it already holds different content, so a
snapshot can never be silently rewritten by a later round bearing the same number.
