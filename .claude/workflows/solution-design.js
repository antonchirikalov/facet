// Solution design from raw input documents: extract, build requirements, design under a critic.
//
// The second archetype, and it exists to answer a question about the first: how much of
// explainer-article.js is the article, and how much is machinery that any document pipeline
// needs? The answer is in this file. Everything between the I/O tail and the audit was copied
// from there with names changed and nothing else; the wiring — what is read, who is called, in
// what order — is new.
//
// One deliberate improvement over the original, forced by this pipeline rather than invented:
// the revision loop is a function here, because this archetype runs it twice (once for the
// requirements, once for the design). In the article script the same code sits inlined once. That
// is what a second archetype is for — it shows which parts are parameters and which are constants.
//
// What this pipeline does NOT do that the article one does: no web search (the sources are given,
// not found), no style critic (an internal design document has no author's voice to protect), no
// arithmetic corrector (there is no worked example to recompute). What it adds: a fan-out whose
// width comes off the disk rather than out of the brief, a two-model contest with a selector, and
// a discovery stage that produces the questions the design could not answer by itself.
//
// Runtime limits respected here, same as the article script: meta is a pure literal; no import();
// no Date.now and no Math.random; the script never touches the filesystem — every file is read and
// written by an agent, and every measurement is made by a python tool through an agent with Bash.
