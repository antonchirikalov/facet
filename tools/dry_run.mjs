// Dry run for a workflow script: execute the real control flow with agent() stubbed out.
//
// Why this exists: a workflow script only fails at the point it reaches, and it reaches the
// end 20 minutes and half a million tokens later. `SOURCE_PATHS is not defined` sat in the
// final return statement and cost a whole run; neither node --check (which parses a .js with
// `export` as CommonJS and stays silent) nor the IDE's diagnostics (an undeclared global is
// valid JavaScript) saw it.
//
// The stub answers every agent() call with a value built from its own schema, so every branch
// the script takes is real code running against real data shapes. Two modes: "ok" drives the
// happy path, "bad" makes every boolean false so the retry, unresolved and gate-failure
// branches execute too.
//
// Usage: node tools/dry_run.mjs <script.js> [ok|bad] ['{"runDir":"dry/run",...}']
//
// The third argument is the `args` the script receives, as JSON. Scripts that validate
// their input reject the default, and that rejection is itself worth exercising.
//
// DRY_ORDER_MISMATCH=1 makes the brief report that the order does not match the brief already on
// disk. That is a refusal, not a failure, so it cannot live in "bad" mode — it would end every
// failure run at the first stage. It gets its own invocation.
