"""Read the round records a revision loop left behind, so a restart does not re-judge.

Why this exists. A dynamic workflow lives inside the CLI process, and that process is
restarted routinely — five self-upgrades and one idle exit in a single working day of the
machine this was built on. The artifacts of a run survive that, because agents write them to
disk; the *verdicts* did not, because they lived only in the values agents returned. So a
restart made the pipeline pay its two most expensive agents again to re-read an article they
had already judged, and the round budget became per-launch instead of per-article: three
restarts meant six rounds of revision where the brief allowed two.

The record itself is written by an agent (the script has no filesystem), one file per round,
in the plain numbered form ``verbatim_writer`` produces. This script only parses them back,
and it is a script rather than a model for the same reason ``gate.py`` is: recovering "which
round were we on" by reading prose is exactly the judgement that comes back different every
time it is asked.

The output envelope matches gate.py's — ``ok``/``problems``/``measures`` — so the agent that
carries deterministic checks can carry this one too without learning a second shape.
