"""One line per deterministic check, appended where the run can be read afterwards.

Everything these tools measure travels back through an agent and into `log()`, which lives in
the workflow's own transcript and is summarised there. That is enough while a run is watched and
almost nothing once it is over: reconstructing what actually happened meant opening per-agent
JSONL transcripts and matching them by hand, and the one time it mattered — a carrier silently
returning two rounds where the tool had printed five — the evidence was only recoverable because
the tool could be re-run against the same directory afterwards.

So each tool records its own call. Not the agent: the agent is forbidden to create files, and
that rule has already paid for itself twice. The tool writing its own log is a different act —
it is the measurement leaving a receipt, and the receipt is written by whoever did the measuring.

Bounded on purpose. The line carries the arguments, the verdict, the measurements and the
problems — never the payload. A listing of two hundred files belongs in the answer to the
caller, not in a log meant to stay readable after fifty of them.

    A failure to write the receipt must not fail the measurement — the caller is branching on
    the numbers, and losing a run because a directory was read-only would be a worse outcome
