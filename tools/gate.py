"""Deterministic content gates for generated documents.

Why a separate script instead of asking a model: every rule here is arithmetic or a
regex, and a workflow script cannot read the filesystem itself. So a cheap agent runs
this command and returns its JSON, and the orchestrating script branches on the numbers
without ever opening the file. The output format is the one the old engine wrote into
`gate_report.json`, so reports stay comparable across the two implementations.

Prose is measured separately from the file, and that distinction was learned the hard
way: a brief asking for "8 to 12 thousand characters" means readable text, while the
file also carries markdown, tables, fenced formulas and figure captions. A live article
measured 13 662 characters as a file and 11 111 without whitespace; its critic spent a
remark on length in all three of its rounds and the piece still shipped over budget.

Exit code is 0 even when the gate fails: the verdict travels in the JSON, and a non-zero
exit would read to the calling agent as "the command broke". Pass --strict when you want
the process to fail too, which is what a hook wants.

# add a phrase should not mean opening a parser.

# Windows depends on the codepage and on which shell the carrying agent picked. A file sidesteps
# it completely — the path is ASCII, the contents are UTF-8 read by Python.

# One regex per line. `#` starts a comment, blank lines are ignored. Matched OUTSIDE code:
# fenced blocks and inline code are removed first, because `d_k ** 0.5` is a power and
