"""Is another run working in this directory right now?

The question has no answer today, and that cost a run. A run directory looked finished — its
tool log had been quiet for six minutes — so a second run was started into it. The first was
alive: the quiet was its source finders working, which produce no tool calls at all. The two
then wrote the same analysis file from two processes, and which version the writer read is no
longer establishable. The rake was already in CLAUDE.md; knowing about it did not help, because
"is a run going" was not observable.

It is observable through the tool log. Every stage that measures anything appends a line with
a timestamp, so a log whose last line is younger than the idle window means someone is working.
That is a heuristic and it is named as one: a run can be quiet longer than the window while an
agent thinks, and a crashed run leaves a log that ages into "free" — the first is a false alarm
the caller can override, the second resolves itself after the window. Both beat the current
answer, which is silence.

The clock comes from outside, in `--now`. A workflow script has no `Date.now()` — the runtime
removes it, or resuming would break — so a script cannot ask "how long ago" without being told
when now is. Same reason the run directory is minted outside and passed in.

The output envelope is gate.py's, so the agent that carries deterministic checks carries this
one too.

Two refinements, both paid for by a launch that stopped for nothing.

The final audit of a stage writes its receipt with `release: true`, and a log whose last
working line is a release is free however young it is. Stages are launched back to back — a
human reads the research output and starts the draft two minutes later — and without the
marker the draft's lock read the research's own closing audit as "someone is working here".
A crashed run never reaches its audit, so it still has to age out through the window.

And this check's own receipts do not count as activity: asking whether a directory is busy is
not working in it. Without that, a launch that failed for another reason right after asking
left a fresh "busy" line behind, and the relaunch a minute later was locked out by its own
question.
