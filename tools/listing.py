"""List the files in a directory, so a workflow script can fan out over what was actually found.

A workflow script has no filesystem. Every path it uses it has to know in advance, and that
rule shaped the research stage: the fan-out runs over the aspects the brief declares, because
those are the only filenames knowable before an agent runs. It works, and it costs something
that went unnoticed for a long time.

The source finder writes one file per aspect — the path the script named — and, following its
own contract, one file per source it kept. The script passes on the four it knows about. In a
measured run that was 79 KB of 260 KB: twenty-four files searched for, read, paid for, written
to disk, and never opened by anything downstream. The writer quoted a summary of an aspect
where a note on a specific source was sitting next to it, which is the likeliest reason
attribution errors survived eleven rounds of critics.

Enumerating a directory is not the same as asking an agent where it put something. The script
still names every path it writes; this only reports what is there, deterministically, so a
second fan-out can run over files nobody could have named in advance.

The output envelope matches gate.py's, so the agent that carries deterministic checks carries
this one too without learning a second shape.
