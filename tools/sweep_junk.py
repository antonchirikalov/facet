"""Remove stray empty directories the figgybanana CLI drops into the repository root.

Runs of the illustration pipeline leave empty directories behind with names like
`OF_PROCESSORS=16`, `Sectigo (AAA)`, `Shell`, and strings of CJK mojibake — ten of them in one
run, in pairs, appearing within seconds of each `paperbanana generate` call. They are always
empty and always in the current working directory of the CLI call.

What is established: they come from inside paperbanana's execution, not from the shell commands
the agent runs (those were read back from the transcripts and are well-formed). Isolated
reproduction failed for every component tried separately — a `--cost-only` run, the ss_gateway
bridge spawned three times, and the `claude` CLI spawned exactly as its provider spawns it.

What is established about the likely path: on Windows `claude` is a `.cmd` shim, so the
provider's `--system-prompt` argument travels through cmd.exe. Past roughly 8 KB the call dies
with "The command line is too long" (measured: fine at 4-12 KB, dead at 20 KB), and below that
limit the prompt text still passes through a shell that interprets `>`, `&`, `|` and `%VAR%`.
That is the one mechanism found that can create entries in the current directory out of prompt
text, and it explains both the mojibake and the environment-variable fragment. Not proven.

So this is a broom, not a fix. The fix belongs in figgybanana: pass the system prompt through
stdin like the user prompt already is. Until then a deterministic sweep beats hunting the same
directories by hand after every run.

Stray FILES are the second half of the problem and were invisible here for a long time, because
this tool only ever looked at directories. Agents drop working files into the repository root —
`temp_data.py`, `rounds_output.json`, `final_structured_output.json`, `rounds_structured.json`
were all found there across one working day, and `git add -A` committed three of them. They come
from a different mechanism than the mojibake directories: an agent redirecting a command's output
to a file to read it back, instead of returning it.

Safety: only empty directories are removed, only from the repository root, and only ones not in
KEEP. A directory holding a single file anywhere below it is left alone and reported. Files are
reported but never removed without `--files`, and a file git tracks is never removed at all —
deleting a source file to tidy up is worse than any amount of clutter.
