"""Mint a fresh run directory name, because a workflow script cannot.

`Date.now()` and `new Date()` are unavailable inside a workflow script — they would break the
resume machinery, so the runtime removes them. A script therefore cannot name a run after the
moment it started, and the run directory has to arrive from outside, in `args.runDir`.

That is a footgun and it fired. Seven launches of one article all went into `probe-runs/attn4`,
and the reuse-from-disk machinery did exactly what it was built to do: it picked up whatever was
already there. Excellent while continuing an interrupted run, and wrong while comparing two: the
second run inherits the first one's research, its material and its draft, and the comparison
measures nothing. Two runs pointed at the same directory at once did worse — one overwrote the
other's article mid-round, and which agent produced the surviving text could not be established.

So: a new directory per experiment, minted here where a clock exists. Continuing a run means
passing its directory back deliberately, which is a different act from starting one and now
looks different too.
