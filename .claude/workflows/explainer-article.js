// Explanatory article from a topic: find sources, reconcile them, write under a critic.
//
// This script is an orchestrator and nothing else. It does not tell the library agents how to
// do their work — they already know, from their own definitions in .claude/agents/, generated
// from library/agents/<name>/prompt.md. What the script does is wire artifacts to ports, check
// that every artifact was actually produced, fan out, loop, and branch on verdicts.
//
// That rule was learned expensively. The previous version carried 9 902 characters of prompt
// text — 39% of the file — and one of those hand-written passages contradicted the analyst's
// own instructions: its prompt.md says the output is "one file conforming to analysis@v1"
// while the script demanded a specific path. The agent sat between two descriptions of its
// own output and produced neither. Invariant I5 exists for exactly this: I/O instructions are
// never hand-written.
//
// No prompt remains. Every call site is a library agent that already knows its job, and what
// leaves this file is only what the script alone knows: paths, commands, items, round numbers.
// The brief node was the last holdout — justified as "a builtin, engine code rather than an
// agent", which was true in refract and stopped being true here, where nothing executes
// anything.
//
// The round is a chain and then a fan-out: writer, then two correctors that fix what is
// decidable (the example's arithmetic, the claims against the notes), then the gate, then two
// critics in parallel on what is left. That shape was arrived at expensively. With the writer
// and two general critics alone, a live run spent six rounds and five million tokens, and the
// same five remarks came back word for word: a critic can only report a misattribution, and
// reporting it costs a round to fix. Anything a corrector can settle should never become a
// remark at all.
//
// Style is not a prompt here either. The author's voice lives in library/style/author-voice.md
// and travels as an input port to the writer and to the style critic; the mechanical half of
// it — bold and dead phrases — is a named preset inside tools/gate.py. Neither is written into
// this file, for the same reason nothing else is: a style description duplicated between the
// one who writes and the one who judges stops being one description after the first edit.
//
// Runtime limits respected here: meta is a pure literal; no import(); no Date.now and no
// Math.random; the script never touches the filesystem — every file is read and written by an
// agent, and every measurement is made by tools/gate.py through an agent that has Bash.

//
// The hardcode that stays is the SHAPE of the pipeline: which stages exist, which agent runs
// each one, which artifact each one leaves, and which of them may fail without stopping the
// run. That is the thing this file is for.
//
// Everything that is a number, a threshold, a model or a language policy is a default here
// and an override in `args.config`. The test is whether two legitimate runs of this same
// pipeline would want different values: two do want different models, different round
// budgets and a different voice, and none of them want a different stage order. A value you
// have to edit the script to change is a value nobody changes.

// --- Segments: which part of the pipeline this launch runs -----------------------------------
//
// A workflow lives inside the CLI process, and the process does not survive a restart, a session
// moved to a background job, or a quota wall. A run that does everything therefore risks
// everything: forty minutes of research died once because the process that held them went away
// mid-draft.
//
// So a launch is a segment. `research` ends with material on disk; `draft` ends with an article
// and the round records. Each is small enough to lose cheaply, and the boundary between them is
// where a person would look anyway. Figures are already their own workflow.
//
// One file rather than two, deliberately. The two segments share the configuration block, the
// I/O tail, the schemas and the gate commands — about a hundred and twenty lines. Split across
// files with no `import()` available, those hundred and twenty lines become two copies that
// drift, which is the failure this project keeps paying for. The stage list selects; nothing is
// duplicated.

// presets, which hunt its dead phrases. Both were hardcoded to Russian, which is invisible
// until someone orders an English article and gets a critic looking for «стоит отметить» and
// «ёлочки» in it — reporting nothing, approving everything, and costing a stage.
//
// So the language chooses them, and the language comes from the brief, which got it from the
// order. A language with no entry here gets `no_bold` (formatting, not vocabulary) and NO style
// critic — and the absence is recorded as an open item rather than passed off as approval,
// because "nobody checked" and "checked and fine" are the same thing only to a report nobody
// reads.
//

// the table says so directly.

// --- No prompts in this file ----------------------------------------------------------------
//
// There are none left. Every agent this script calls is a library agent that already knows its

// gate_runner and verbatim_writer — the brief node in particular used to be justified as "a
// builtin, engine code rather than an agent", which was true in refract and stopped being a
// reason once nothing here executes anything.
//
// The test is simple: a string in this file that would still make sense if the pipeline were
// about invoices instead of articles is orchestration. Anything else belongs in a prompt.md.

// --- The I/O tail, generated the same way for every agent -----------------------------------
//
// A hand-written stand-in for refract's prompt.py, which builds this section from the agent's
// port contract. Until that is ported, this function is the single place where an agent is
// told what it gets and where it puts the result — one wording for all of them, instead of
// nine hand-written variants that drift apart.

// --- Measurement: python counts, an agent carries, the script decides -------------------------
//
// The script has no shell, so it cannot run the gate itself; the agent exists only to carry the
// command and bring the JSON back. Python does the counting because a model cannot: asked to
// judge length by eye, two critics said 10 500-11 500 where the answer was 10 033.

// The bounds are optional on purpose: a run whose order said nothing about length gets a
// measurement and no verdict. gate.py with no rule still reports chars and prose_chars.
// The forbidden patterns arrive as file paths, and the paths are ASCII: Cyrillic through argv
// on Windows depends on the codepage and on which shell the carrying agent picked. The patterns
// themselves are UTF-8 inside the file, read by python, and they are data a person edits —
// editorial policy for one language, not a constant inside a parser.
//
// They live here rather than in a critic's remarks because a regex settles them, and a rule a
// regex can settle should never cost a revision round. The style critic then spends its rounds
// on rhythm and voice, which no regex reaches.
// `--log` on every command, always the same file. The tool writes its own receipt: the carrying
// agent is forbidden to create files, and that rule has paid for itself twice — this is the
// measurement leaving a record, written by whoever did the measuring.

//
//   - twenty-five source notes written by the finders, passed to nobody;
//   - a dead finder's whole directory, dropped because the aspect left the list;
//   - `_index.json`, written every run since the beginning, read for the first time today;
//   - an agent's scratch `rounds_output.json`, sitting in the run directory.
//
// `touched` is every path that reached an agent. The disk is what is actually there. The
// difference is the loss, and it is reported by name rather than counted, because a number tells
// you that something went missing and a name tells you what.
