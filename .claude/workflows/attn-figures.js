// Illustrate an article that is already written: plan the figures it needs, render them with
// the figgybanana CLI, look at what came out, redraw what failed.
//
// The drawing itself is not ours. figgybanana runs its own five-agent pipeline per figure
// (retriever, planner, stylist, visualizer, vision critic), and this script only commissions
// it and judges the result. Two model slots are set explicitly on every call:
//
//   --vlm-provider claude_code --vlm-model sonnet      planner and stylist
//   --critic-vlm-provider kimi --critic-vlm-model k3   the vision critic only
//
// Kimi K3 sits in the critic slot on purpose. It is the slot that looks at the rendered image,
// which is what its vision is wanted for, and the Kimi-for-Coding quota is small — spending it
// on the critic alone stretches it about three times further than putting Kimi on every agent.
// When that quota runs out the CLI is called again without the two critic flags, so the critic
// falls back to claude_code sonnet; the agent reports which slot filled it per figure.
//
// Images go through ss_gateway and nowhere else. A 401 from the gateway means its bridge has no
// token in the Windows keychain (fix: open "SS AI Setup", press Apply) — it is not a reason to
// reach for a public image key, and silently switching providers is how a run stops testing
// what it was built to test.
//
// Every string in this file is English, including the ones only a person reads. The articles
// are Russian; the machinery that makes them is not, and a script that mixes the two gives a
// model one more reason to switch language halfway through a run.

  `legible; is the notation the same as in the text; are there invented elements the article ` +
  `does not have; are the directions of any relations reversed; is the picture empty or a ` +
  `mess. Typos inside the picture's labels are a defect and they are visible.\n\n` +
  `Separately and pedantically — CYRILLIC. Image generators break it: letters get substituted ` +
  `and words turn into Russian-looking noise. Read every Russian label out to yourself: if it ` +
  `is not a real word, that is a defect, and say which label went wrong. An article with a ` +
  `figure that has gibberish written on it is worse than an article with no figure.\n\n` +
  `If you crop fragments to inspect details, put them in ${WORK_DIR}, not in ${FIGURES_DIR}: ` +

  `is the step at which what a quick glance skips becomes visible.\n\n` +
  `THE LANGUAGE OF THE LABELS. The article is Russian, so the worded labels are Russian. Latin ` +
  `is allowed for: notation and formulas (X, Q, K, V, W^Q, n × d_k, d_model) and the terms the ` +
  `article itself writes in Latin — softmax and Attention. Anything else in English is a ` +
  `defect: "output" instead of «выход», "shape unchanged" instead of «форма не меняется», ` +
  `"Concat" where the article speaks of concatenation. Three figures in one article must be in ` +
  `one language; a mismatch between them is a defect even if each reads fine on its own.\n\n` +
  `THE TYPOGRAPHY OF THE NOTATION. Subscripts must be subscripts: d_k and d_v are printed as a ` +
  `d with a small k or v below, not as "d_k" with an underscore in the middle of the line. A ` +
  `raw underscore in a formula is a defect, and it is especially visible when both spellings ` +
